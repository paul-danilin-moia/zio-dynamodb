# High Level API
The High Level API methods rely on a ZIO Schema for a particular type being in implicit scope. This is achieved using the `DeriveSchema.gen` macro. Internally codecs are automatically generated for the case classes based on the meta data provided by the Schema's.

```scala
case class Person(id: String, name: String)
object Person {
  implicit val schema: Schema.CaseClass2[String, String, Person] = DeriveSchema.gen[Person]
  val (id, name) = ProjectionExpression.accessors[Person]
}
```

In the above example `Person.id` and `Person.name` are `ProjectionExpression`s automatically generated by the `ProjectionExpression.accessors` method.
They are used as a springboard for creating further type safe APIs eg 
- `Person.id === "1"` creates a `ConditionExpression`
- `Person.name.set("Smith")` creates an `UpdateExpression`
- `Person.id.partitionKey === "1"` creates a primary key expression

There are also type safe query creation methods in the DynamoDBQuery companion object such as `get`, `put`, `update`, `deleteFrom`, `queryAll` etc etc
